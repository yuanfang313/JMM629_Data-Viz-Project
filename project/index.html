            I think I can safely say that, The
            <strong> Pritzker Architecture Prize</strong> is the "Nobel Prize" for architects (check the detailed description of the prize in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize">Wikipedia</a>
            ). This project is a try to reveal some facts of people who had won the prize, and hopefully give you a chance to take a glance of the mysterious life of these brilliant architects as a group.

            <p id="updatedIntro_life" class="updatedIntro">
              Many people might think Master Architects are born to be
              "Master". But of course, Master Architects also share something
              in life with anyone else -- they all had an origin (no matter in
              terms of space or time), all used to be young and finally all
              need to face death. While the contents in this section are
              mainly basic facts of the laureates, it might be interesting to
              see them presented in aggregate.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_gender" class="updatedIntro">
              Like many other fields, architecture industry had been dominated
              by male since architecture became organized as a profession. In
              an interview, the first female architect who had won the
              Pritzker Architecture Prize, Zaha Hadid, were asked, “Do you
              think the profession is gender biased?” She answered, “I don’t
              think it is profession… I think people are biased.”
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_nation" class="updatedIntro">
              From it was founded in 1979, the Pritzker Architecture Prize had
              been awarded to architects all around the world. It's said to be
              awarded "irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology".
              The contents in this part is not only showing the nationality of
              architects when they won the prize but also the country of
              birth, where might have cultural influences for them.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_glass" class="updatedIntro">
              In public view, like wearing black, the preference of wearing
              black, round, plastic-frame spectacles is a stereotype of
              architects, which originated from Le Corbusier and his famous
              owlish glasses. However, the contents in this part only focus on
              showing whether these Master Architects wear glasses but not the
              styles. It shows that only 18 out of 48 laureates wearing
              glasses.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_zodiac" class="updatedIntro"></p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_young" class="updatedIntro">
              Due to the unique nature of the profession, very few architects
              establish their reputation of career when they were young.
              Therefore, in the impression of the public (even people in this
              field), most Master Architects are a group of people passed
              middle age, as if they were always like that. In this part,
              let's take a glance of what they were look like when they were
              young/ younger (couldn't find the data of 1996 and 1986
              laureate).
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_old" class="updatedIntro">
              Instead of saying most Master Architects live a long life,
              living a long life gives them more chances to become masters in
              this field, which would enable them to build more projects.
              While from 1988, 15 out of 48 laureates had passed away, among whom Zaha Hadid was the youngest (passed
              away at 65,
              2016),
              Oscar Niemeyer was the oldest (passed away at 104, 2012), and
              the average is 86.

            <!-- education -->
            <p id="updatedIntro_education" class="updatedIntro">
              Like many other design subjects, Architecture is considered hard
              to learn and teach. In modern times, normally studying in the
              college is the first part of the whole process of training for
              architects. This section dedicates to show where did the
              laureates receive their formal training before becoming
              architects, and their roles in architectural education
              in later life.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_educationGeneral" class="updatedIntro">
              Architecture had been considered a complex profession extremely
              hard to learn by oneself. However, before the system of
              apprenticeship with master builders was widely replaced by
              modern architectural education, many great modern architects,
              like Le Corbusier (1887 - 1965), Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 -
              1959), Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886 - 1969), lacked formal
              training as an architect.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_educationAbroad" class="updatedIntro">
              Learning architecture abroad, no matter via study in the
              college, travel, or work for Master Architects can bring great
              impacts to young architects. The contents in this part only
              focus on showing whether the laureates had studied architecture
              abroad in the college.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_teach" class="updatedIntro">
              Lots of Master Architects are invited as guest professors or
              visiting professors all around the world, and some of them have
              long-term professorship in the University. The data in this part
              mainly comes from the biography provided by the website of The
              Pritzker Architecture Prize and Wikipedia. The architects who
              are labeled with "NA" mean there are no contents about
              "teaching" in the two data source.
            </p>

            <!-- career -->
            <p id="updatedIntro_career" class="updatedIntro">
              To a great extents, the career of an architect is built up by
              his or her architecture projects in the real context. But this
              section won't include contents about their projects, but other
              career-related aspects, like other career they had considered,
              the trips and figures important to their works, when did they
              won one of the world's premier professional recognition, and
              etc.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_otherCareer" class="updatedIntro">
              Not all the Master Architects want to make "architecture" their
              life-long pursue from the very beginning. Among the laureates of
              the Pritzker Architecture Prize, some of them had thought about
              <span class="hightLightedTexts orange">following their father's profession,</span>
              some of them had
              <span class="hightLightedTexts red">learned other subjects</span>
              in the undergraduate, and some of them even had been quite
              successful in
              <span class="hightLightedTexts blue">the career before.</span>
              In this part, let's take a look of the other career they had
              considered.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_travel" class="updatedIntro">
              Traveling can make a big impact to architects. Some laureates
              took a number of trips while studied and worked in other
              countries, some traveled to see
              <span class="hightLightedTexts blue">the works of the architects they admired,</span>
              and some got the opportunity to
              <span class="hightLightedTexts green">meet and even work with these Master Architects</span>
              during the stay. However, some architects, like 2010 laureates,
              Kazuyo Sejim, were described by the critics as "the generation
              of architects trained by television and video".
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_age" class="updatedIntro">
              As the award that's often referred to as the Nobel Prize of
              architecture, many laureates had passed their middle age when
              they won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Since 1979, the
              youngest is 2010 laureate, Ryue Nishizawa at age 44, and the
              oldest is 2018 laureate, B.V. Doshi at age 90. And the average
              age of the laureates is 63 (round to the nearest integer).
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_work" class="updatedIntro">
              Working together can bring architects opportunities to learn
              from each other. While most Master Architects have their unique
              perspective of architecture and working style, had those
              influenced by someone else? It would be interesting to see which
              of these laureates had worked together, which might have impact
              on their own career.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_esTime" class="updatedIntro">
              (The "numbers" in the grids stand for the years it took) For
              architects, "establish one's own practice" normally means open
              their own firm/ studio (with partners). This part focus on the
              period between they received their first architecture degree and
              established their own practice, during which some of them chose
              <span class="hightLightedTexts red">
                further study in the college</span>, or
              <span class="hightLightedTexts blue">worked for other architects</span>, or
              <span class="hightLightedTexts green">traveled around</span>, or
              <span class="hightLightedTexts orange">taught in the university</span>.
            </p>
            <p id="updatedIntro_wonTime" class="updatedIntro">
              (The "numbers" in the grids stand for the years it took) Every
              laureate has its unique contribution to architecture, no matter
              when received the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Some laureates
              established their names in the field a long time before
              receiving the Pritzker Architecture Prize. And some laureates
              spent many years to improve themselves before establishing their
              own practice. Therefore, this section is not to compare the time
              it takes to become a laureate but encourage readers to explore
              the story behind the numbers.
