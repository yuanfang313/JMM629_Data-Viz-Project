                    I think I can safely say that, The
                    <strong> Pritzker Architecture Prize</strong> is the "Nobel Prize"
                    for architects (check the detailed description of the prize in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize">Wikipedia</a>
                    ). This project is a try to reveal some facts of people who had won
                    the prize, and hopefully give you a chance to take a glance of the
                    mysterious life of these brilliant architects as a group.

                            Many people might think Master Architects are born to be "Master". But of course, Master
                            Architects also share something in life with anyone else -- they all had an origin (no
                            matter in terms of space or time), all used to be young and finally all need to face death.
                            While the contents in this section are mainly basic facts of the laureates, it might be
                            interesting to see them presented in aggregate.

                            Like many other fields, architecture industry had been dominated by male since architecture
                            became organized as a profession. In an interview, the first female architect who had won
                            the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Zaha Hadid, were asked, “Do you think the profession is
                            gender biased?” She answered, “I don’t think it is profession… I think people are biased.”

                        <p id="updatedIntro_nation" class="updatedIntro">
                            From it was founded in 1979, the Pritzker Architecture Prize had been awarded to architects
                            all around the world. It's said to be awarded "irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or
                            ideology". The contents in this part is not only showing the nationality of architects when
                            they won the prize but also the country of birth, where might have cultural influences for
                            them.

                            In public view, like wearing black, the preference of wearing black, round, plastic-frame
                            spectacles is a stereotype of architects, which originated from Le Corbusier and his famous
                            owlish glasses. However, the contents in this part only focus on showing whether these
                            Master Architects wear glasses but not the styles. It shows that only 18 out of 48 laureates
                            wearing glasses.

                            Due to the unique nature of the profession, very few architects establish their reputation
                            of career when they were young. Therefore, in the impression of the public (even people in
                            this field), most Master Architects are a group of people passed middle
                            age, as if they were always like that. In this part, let's take a glance of what they were
                            look like when they were young/ younger (couldn't find the data of 1996 and 1986 laureate).

                            Instead of saying most Master Architects live a long life, living a long life gives them
                            more chances to become masters in this field, which would enable them to build more
                            projects. While from 1988, 15 out of 48 laureates had passed away, among which Zaha Hadid
                            was the youngest (passed away at 65, 2016), Oscar Niemeyer was the oldest (passed away at
                            104, 2012), and the average is 86.

                            Like many other design subjects, Architecture is considered hard to learn and teach.
                            In modern times, normally studying in the college is the first part of the whole
                            process of training for architects. This section dedicates to show where did the laureates
                            receive their formal training before becoming architects, and what are their roles in
                            architectural education in later life.

                            Architecture had been considered a complex profession extremely hard to learn by oneself.
                            However, before the system of apprenticeship with master builders was widely replaced by
                            modern architectural education, many great modern architects, like Le Corbusier (1887 -
                            1965), Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 - 1959), Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886 - 1969), lacked
                            formal training as an architect.

                            on showing whether the laureates had studied architecture abroad in the college.

                            Lots of Master Architects are invited as gest professors or visiting professors all around
                            the world, and some of them have long-term professorship in the University. The data in this
                            part mainly comes from the biography provided by the website of The Pritzker Architecture
                            Prize and Wikipedia. The architects who are labeled with "NA" mean there are no contents

                            Not all the Master Architects want to make "architecture" their life-long pursue from the
                            very beginning. Among the laureates of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, some of them had
                            thought about following their father's profession, some of them had learned other subjects
                            in the undergraduate, and some of them even had been quite successful in the career before.
                            In this part, let's take a look of the other career they had considered.

                            Traveling can make a big impact to architects, especially at the beginning of their career.
                            One of the examples that people most like to talk about is Le Corbusier’s legendary trip
                            through Europe that influenced his entire career and modern architecture. Today, many
                            architecture schools and architecture studios still award the most outstanding students with
                            traveling scholarship.

                            As the award that's often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture, many laureates had
                            passed their middle age when they won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Since 1979, the
                            youngest is 2010 laureate, Ryue Nishizawa at age 44, and the oldest is 2018 laureate, B.V.
                            Doshi at age 90. And the average age of the laureates is 63 (round to the nearest integer).

                            Working together can bring architects opportunities to learn from each other. While most
                            Master Architects have their unique perspective of architecture and working style, had those
                            influenced by someone else? It would be interesting to see which of these laureates had
                            worked together, which might have impact on their own career.

                            (The numbers means the number of years it takes) For architects, "establish one's own
                            practice" normally means open their own firm/ studio (with partners). This part focus on the
                            period between they received their first architecture degree and established their own
                            practice, during which many of them chose to continue their education, or worked for other
                            architects, or taught in the university, or traveled around the world. Among 48 laureates,
                            only 1988 and 1990 laureates, Gordon Bunshaft and Aldo Rossi never established their own
                            firm/ studio.

                            (The numbers means the number of years it takes) Every laureate has its unique contribution
                            to architecture, no matter whether received the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Some laureates
                            established their names in the field a long time before receiving the Pritzker Architecture
                            Prize. Some laureates spent many years to improve themselves before establishing their own
                            practice in the field. Therefore, this section is not to compare the time it takes to become
                            a laureate but encourage readers to think about the story behind the numbers.
